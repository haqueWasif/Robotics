Local Variable:
-> Variable which is only accesable by the function in which it is declared

Global Variable:
-> Variable which is accessable by all functions 

# In Arduino function name and variable name can be same for local variables
# Local Variable and Global variable can share same name in Arduino 
( Local Variables get preference in that case )

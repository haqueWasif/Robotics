# Arduino plays the part of processor in a robot


Arduino -> A development board with microcontroller

microcontroller -> A chip placed on the board


Types of Arduino
-> Nano ( Pin number less )
-> UNO ( Pin number more )
-> Mega ( Pin number most )


# Selecting what type of arduino is to be used depends upon the project 


# Processor and microcontroller are different 

Processor -> Used in computer ( have more calculation power )
microcontroller -> Used in arduino ( have less calculation power )


# Arduino takes electrical signal as input and process it and gives electricl signal as output

Digital signal -> 0 ( 0 voltage ) and 1 ( 5 voltage )


How does Arduino take INPUT ?
-> Sensor is used to take input and is connected with arduino
-> Sensor generates an electrical signal and passes it to arduino
-> Digital sensors ( Flame ) are connected with digital pins (0 to 13) generates a digital signal and passes it to arduino
-> Analog sensors ( Sonar, Temperature ) are connected with analog pins (A0 to A5) generates a analog signal and passes it to arduino 


How does Arduino PROCESS a data?
-> The electrical signal that is received by arduino is displayed as numbers on screen based on these numbers different logics are developed using a programming language (similar to C++)
-> Can take both digital and analog signal as input but can give output only digital signals


Different types of Pin in Arduino
-> Digital input / output pin
-> Analog input pin
-> PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pin ( Digital output pin but acts like an analog output pin )
-> Tx / Rx pin ( Transmitter Receiver Pin )
-> Power pin


# To understand this we can think of one such project of sensing temperature and controlling fan
-> Analog sensor is used to sense temperature and the Electrical signal generated by the sensor is received by the arduino
-> For turning the fan on and off if the temperature is greater than a certain value digital signal is given as output through the digital output pins by arduino
-> For regulating the speed of fan if we want the fan to rotate in a certain speed the PWM pins gives output which varies from minimum to maximum voltage ( for example: 0V to 5V )


Use of Tx / Rx pin
-> Arduino tries to communicate with another arduino, rasberry pi, any blutooth module
-> To communicate with computer
-> 0 and 1 pins of digital input / output pins

# Bluetooth modules are devices that allow wireless communication between electronic devices 
(for example: Connecting wireless headphone to smartphone )

# Communicate means exchange of data 


Power pin
-> Generates a fixed voltage ( multimeter will always show a fixed value )
-> Generally 3 ground pins and 2 voltage pins (5V and 3.3V) in arduino UNO


How to POWER UP an Arduino ?
-> By laptop, By Battery
-> In real life project normally we use battery (specially lipo battery)
-> 5V is required for powering up more than that then the arduino will get fried and less than that the arduino will not work properly


Q7. What are the limitations and constraints of using Arduino in projects ?
-> One limitation of using Arduino in projects is that it can only run one program at a time
-> Another limitation of using Arduino in projects is its memory and processing power
-> Additionally, Arduino has limited built-in communication capabilities and peripherals


Q8. How can Arduino be used in robotics projects ?
-> Arduino can be used in robotics projects in a variety of ways. Arduino boards are microcontrollers that can be programmed to control the behavior of robots. They can be used to control the movement of motors, read sensor data, and make decisions based on that data.

For example, an Arduino board can be used to control the movement of a robot’s wheels by sending signals to the motors. The Arduino can also read data from sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, or light sensors, and use that data to make decisions about how the robot should move.

Arduino boards can also be used to control other components of a robot, such as LED lights or speakers. For example, an Arduino board can be programmed to make a robot’s eyes light up or to play a sound when the robot detects an obstacle.

Overall, Arduino provides a flexible and accessible platform for building and controlling robots. Its open-source nature and large community of users make it easy to find resources and support for building robotics projects with Arduino.
